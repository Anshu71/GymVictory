# Gym_Tech


This Website is an e-commerce website designed for a gym that offers fitness and sports products. The website will provide information about the gym's facilities, classes, and personal training services. Customers can browse and purchase gym equipment, sports accessories, and supplements online. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and is hosted on a web server. The project acknowledges the use of open-source libraries and frameworks, including jQuery, and Bootstrap. 

The login authentication and validation feature is integrated into the website's existing user account system. Users can create an account by providing their email address and password. The system checks the email address and password against a database of registered users to ensure that the information is valid. Once the user is logged in, they can access their account information and make purchases securely.
